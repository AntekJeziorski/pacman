# Pac-Man - AI powered game project
Pac-Man, the iconic arcade game, has captivated players for decades with its simpleyet addictive gameplay. Released in 1980, Pac-Man introduced the world to a hungry, yellow character navigating through a maze, devouring dots and evading ghosts. The design of this application was prepared as a project for .Net Java platform course. The application uses implementations of simple AI to determine the paths of opponent ghosts.  With 3 approaches, the player can navigate PacMan through the maze, avoiding the ghosts and collecting points, which are checked for being a record at the end of the game and saved accordingly to a CSV file if necessary. 

## build
The application was prepared based on JDK 18.0.2. We recommend using an IDE such as InteliJ IDEA to compile and run the project.
